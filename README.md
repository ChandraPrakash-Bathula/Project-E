# EliteNotes : Web Application with multi-Machine Learning Models

Welcome to our Flask-based web application that integrates powerful machine learning models for text and media processing tasks. This repository hosts a user-friendly interface where users can leverage the capabilities of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to perform a variety of tasks.

## Features

### Translation

Our application offers seamless translation capabilities, allowing users to translate text from one language to another. This feature is particularly useful for users who need to communicate across language barriers.

### Transcription

Users can convert audio or video files into text transcripts with our transcription feature. This functionality comes in handy for tasks such as generating subtitles, extracting content from lectures, and more.

### Keyword Prediction

Our keyword prediction model helps users extract essential keywords from text documents. This feature aids in summarization, content analysis, and search engine optimization (SEO) by identifying key terms within a document.

### Summarization

The summarization feature condenses lengthy text documents into concise summaries. Users can quickly grasp the main points of a document, making this feature invaluable for tasks such as reading comprehension, document analysis, and information retrieval.

## Libraries and Dependencies

Our web application leverages the following libraries and frameworks:

- **Flask**: Flask is a lightweight web application framework for Python. It provides the foundation for building our web interface and handling user requests.

- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: NLTK is a comprehensive library for natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging.

- **Transformers**: The Transformers library, developed by Hugging Face, offers state-of-the-art pre-trained models for natural language understanding (NLU) and generation (NLG) tasks.

- **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**: SSL is a cryptographic protocol that ensures secure communication over the internet. We use SSL for secure data transmission between the client and server.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   https://github.com/ChandraPrakash-Bathula/EliteNotes.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask application:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

4. Access the web application in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, users can perform the following tasks:

1. **Translation**: Enter text in the source language and select the target language for translation.

2. **Transcription**: Upload an audio or video file, and the application will transcribe the content into text.

3. **Keyword Prediction**: Input text, and the application will identify and display relevant keywords.

4. **Summarization**: Paste or type a long text document, and the application will generate a concise summary.

## Project Structure

The repository structure is organized as follows:

- `app.py`: Flask application file containing route definitions and server configuration.
- `views.py`: Contains view functions for handling user requests and interacting with the models.
